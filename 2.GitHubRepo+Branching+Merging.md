# Setup with GitHub Creating a Repository Online

1) Download your repository from Github

or

create a new repository on the command line (from the beginning)

- `$ git init`
- `$ git add README.md`
- `$ git commit -m "commitmessage" `
- `$ git remote add origin repo-url`
- `$ git push -u origin master`

or push an existing repository from the command line

- `$ git remote add origin repo-url`
- `$ git push -u origin master`

…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.


Once you've done that you'll need to create a branch. I found it easiest just to create a Branch on Github. Branching is the way you can test things out. It's an isolated environment where you can edit and play with your code before merging back onto the master once it's stable.

I had an issue where I was cloned the Master and my branch was within the Master. This wasn't a smart ideas as when I was always commit and merging my branch (back into the master) it would then merge back into the "True Master"

How best to avoid the above is to create a branch on GitHub


# Clone
To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, you need to use `git clone`

`git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`
Clones a repository to your computer

While logged in to GitHub, these URLs are available below the repository details:

![Clone](https://github.com/VerdeNotte/VersionControl-Git-Github/blob/master/Clone.PNG "Clone URL")

When you run git clone, the following actions occur:

> -A new folder called repo is made
> -It is initialized as a Git repository
> -A remote named `origin` is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
> -All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
> -The default branch (usually called master) is checked out


# Branches + Merging #

You can download the branch by typing

`$ git pull origin branchname`

### Creating a Branch
To create a branch you need to enter the commands
`$ git branch branchname`

To checkout of the master branch and into your branch you need to type

### Going into the Branch###

`$ git checkout branchname`
Now you'll have switched into your branch (instead of the master)

NOTE: Switching branches changes files in your working directory
It’s important to note that when you switch branches in Git, files in your working directory will change. If you switch to an older branch, your working directory will be reverted to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. If Git cannot do it cleanly, it will not let you switch at all.

### You can now type to clear the text in your GitBash

`$ git clear`

### Seeing what branches are there

To see the branches you have you can type
`$ git branch -a`

### Deleting branches

To delete branches you'll have to switch back into the master
`$ git checkout master`

and type

`$ git branch -d branchname` - once it's been merged or
`$ git branch -D branchname`

### Pushing your Branch onto GitHub

If you have created a branch on your computer you can push the changes onto Github with

`git push origin branchname`

You could also push onto a newly created branch

`git push origin HEAD:branchname`



### Merge Conflicts ###
Happens when Git doesn't know which version we want. This happens when someone else has made an edit in the time you have edited your branch. Once you have resolved the conflict, you can simply type

`$ merge commit` These doesn't require a commit message.

### gitChecking who's doing what

To check the log you can types
`$ git log --oneline`

## To see what version of your repository you are using you can see it at the end of the code.
