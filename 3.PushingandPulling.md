## Pushing onto Github ##

You need to connect your local computer to the remote repository.

`$ git remote add origin repo-url`
*You can change origin to a nameofyourchoosing* - Nickname for github project

repo-url refers to the the remote repository URL we copied earlier. origin is a short name for this long URL which comes in handy whenever we have to push some code to remote repository. A local repository can track multiple remote repositories, you just have to use a different short name and origin url.

then you need to push it to the remote server

`$ git push -u origin branchname`



#Pull
`pull` is a combination of `fetch` and `merge`

If your remote repository already contains some code files, then you need to pull them inside your local repository. For that, use the command below.

`$ git pull`

The above three steps can be combined into single step when you already have a remote repository. For that, use the command below

`git clone repo-url [folder]`
Or you can do this manually by downloading it directly from Github.

You can verify if a local repository is tracking the remote repository using git remote -v command which should output below result.

`$ git remote -v`
