### Working on Github together

Github Repository:

Now that you have had a play with your local Git and commandline/Gui. It's now time to start with Github.
There are two ways for you to create a repository, you can either import it or you can create a repository on GitHub (then clone it onto your local repository). You have already created a local repository.


In the top right hand corner
![Creating repositories](https://github.com/VerdeNotte/VersionControl-Git-Github/blob/master/Remote%20Git.PNG)
you'll see these options once you click next to your profile picture.

If you wanted to create a repository on Github (before you then branch/clone it to your local remote)

1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.

Click _Create repository_ . :tada:

Once you have done that you'll need to Clone it to your local repository!

 # Clone

 To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, you need to use `git clone`

 `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`
Clones a repository to your computer

While logged in to GitHub, these URLs are available below the repository details:

![Clone](https://github.com/VerdeNotte/VersionControl-Git-Github/blob/master/Clone.PNG "Clone URL")

When you run git clone, the following actions occur:

> -A new folder called repo is made
> -It is initialized as a Git repository
> -A remote named `origin` is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
> -All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
> -The default branch (usually called master) is checked out

You can also choose to manually download the repository.
