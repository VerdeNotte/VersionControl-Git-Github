### Working on Github

When working with other people's repositories, there are a few basic Git commands to remember

`$ git clone`
`$ git fetch`
`$ git merge`
`$ git pull`

These commands are very useful when working with a remote repository.

 `clone` and `fetch` download remote code from a repo's remote URL to your local computer

 `merge` is used to merge different people's work together with yours

 `pull` is a combination of `fetch` and `merge`
