# General Helpful things

### Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document. Much easier than learning HTML, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`

You can see the [Github Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists), I also used [Dillinger](dillinger.io) an online Markdown editor to preview what will be shown!
